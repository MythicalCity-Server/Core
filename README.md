# Core

Core is my personal library that is used by other repositories in this organization 

## Features

The following features are built in to this repo:

<ul>
<li>- [<i><a href="#economy">Economy</a></i>]</li>: Handles multiple banks and saving the banks, with different values compatibility
<li>- [<i><a href="#custom-items">Custom Items</a></i>]</li>: Allows the user to create a custom item that can hook on to events with just an annotation
<li>- [<i>TBA</i>]</li>: 
<li>- [<i>TBA</i>]</li>: 
</ul>

## Motivation

Instead of recoding and hand coding each feature, I made a library for each with flexibility to do each.

## Code style

Each feature has a master handler class that handles how the user directly uses the library. For some libraries, a fully integrated abstraction approach was taken like in the custom items library (see below).
